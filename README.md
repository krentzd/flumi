# project-superball
Project Superball (FLUMI = FLUorescence MIcroscopy) simulates stacks of fluorescence microscopy images from a given ground thruth structure. 
The simulation is done in seven steps: (1) Choose pixel-size of voxel grid to scale ground turth structure accordingly,  
(2) Randomly distribute fluorophores, (3) Scale input PSF to fit voxel grid to match spatial sampling, (4) Draw fluorophore photon emission from Poisson distribution, (5) Convolve voxel grid with PSF, (6) Simulate detector resolution by binning output of voxel grid in x, y and z, (7) Add three different noise components: (a) Sensor noise from detection accuracy by drawing value from Poisson distribution with real pixel-value as mean, (b) Analog-to-digital conversion with gain set by user, (c) Additive electronic noise modelled as Gaussian with DC-offset and sigma specified by user.
